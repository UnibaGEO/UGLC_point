UNIFIED GLOBAL LANDSLIDES CATALOG
******************************************

SUMMARY OF FIELDS INCLUDED IN UGLC
__________________________________________
WKT_GEOM: POINT (LONG LAT)

NEW DATASET: UGLC (name of our new dataset)

ID: Unique ID for each landslide

OLD DATASET: Name of the Native dataset

OLD_ID: ID point of the Native dataset

VERSION: Version of the Native dataset

COUNTRY: Country of the point

ACCURACY[m]: Accuracy in metres   

START DATE: Date of the landslides , formato:ISO 8601:YYYY/MM/DD

END DATE: Date of the landslides, format: ISO 8601: YYYY/MM/DD. If we have the exact date of the landslides we will have the start date = end date,
however if we only have the year or period of acquisition of the landslide we will have the start date different from the end date and therefore we
will have the interval in the time in which the landslide probably occurred

TYPE: Type of landsdlise if known and include:
